>- Open then the deltarune ***data.win*** file with UndertaleModTool (data.win located at *C:\Program Files (x86)\SURVEY_PROGRAM)*).
>- Select **Run other script...** inside the **Scripts** section at the top.
>- Chose the previously downloaded file **DeltaPatcherStable.csx** from this git repo and let ir run!
>- Once the opened info window says **Patched!** you can now click Accept and click **File** and then **Save** at the top.
>- Save your patched win game with the name ***game.win***

Please, use the stable version of this script if you don't want a console crash when waking up from the bedroom (in game ofc)
